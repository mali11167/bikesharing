# Bikesharing
# Overview
This project is to convince investrs that a bike shraing program In Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We had good amount of data available to
us to for analysis. We were able to plot our analysis through Tableau to present to the investors. Tableau is a great tool to give the end user the 
detailed analysis for decision making.
# Results
We did our analysis based on seven different plots. The first analysis was check out time by users and then genders. This gave us detailed idea as to 
how many users are using the bike and the duration. Below is our analysis for check out time and users:

Check out time and filtered by gender is as follows:

Our next analysis was based trips by weekdays.We concluded that the busiet hours of the weekday are between 6am-9am. That being the busy
work hours and people in the are chose to ride on bikes rather then cars. The use over the weekend is less as compared to weekdays.

Our analysis based on gender showed that it is more common to use bikes in men than in woman.

We did our analysis in regards to trip duration which showed that the duration time highest and common among users was 5 minutes which again shows that 
the bikes mostly used had short trips.
We did our analysis based on usertype and then sub filtering it by gender type and found that mostly subscriber were male and customers were mostly female.

We also did our analysis to see which bike IDS have been most used.

According to the number of bikes used we did analysis as to how many bikes were due for repairs abd maintenance.

# Summary
I think this analysis gives us a very detailed idea for the business proposal that we need to present to the investors. This business looks like a success 
in terms of the analysis we did.
There are two additonal visulizations I want to add that can give us more detailed analysis:
* We can plot with the latitude/longitude and number of users to see what areas has the most bike users. We would want to establish this business in the work
  district and apartment residestial area where there is more foot traffic and easy access to restaurants, offices, shopping. That will ensure more usage of these bikes. 
* We can also plot number of users and their birth year to see if the users are young population or its a mix combination.
